            <div class="section">
                <p class="section-text">This guide follows through on what effective feedback techniques you can integrate into your feedback to students.</p>
                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal</p>
                <p class="section-text">Provide students with personal feedback relating to their work. Always address the student directly.
                    Personal feedback should only be related to students work and development. Do not give same feedback to multiple students,
                    feedback needs to be personal.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Provide personal feedback in criterion comments and general comments.</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Descriptive</p>
                <p class="section-text"> Descriptive feedback is very good for students. However avoid too much information.
                    Apply this technique in negative comments, to provide the student more information.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Apply descriptive comments in criteria comments and in general comments.</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivational</p>
                <p class="section-text"> Motivating students is important as it encourages them to improve on their work and in their academic
                    development to increase their confidence. To motivate students, provide positive comments in the work, things that they did good on and what they could improve.
                    Rewards is another method of motivation. Reward the student, write a positive overall comment. Avoid comparing to other students.
                    Provide detailed feedback for things that need to be improved.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Provide motivational comments in the general comments.</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Encourage for action</p>
                <p class="section-text"> To provide effective feedback, tutors need to persuade students to take action in order to improve 
                    to get better grades. Persuade students to identify their own milestones in their work and encourage students to have 
                    peer-reviews with other students before submission of work.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Encourage action in general comments.</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Action points</p>
                <p class="section-text"> Action points are an effective way to give the student the actions that they need to do.
                    Write action points as a numerical list.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Write action points in general comments.</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Strengths and weaknesses</p>
                <p class="section-text"> Identifying strengths and weaknesses of a student in the feedback is another part of motivational feedback.
                    Write what the student did good and what could be improved in their work, focusing more on improval.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Provide strengths and weaknesses in general comments.</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Areas for improvement</p>
                <p class="section-text"> Students might need to improve their work in order to achieve their target goals and grades.
                    In relation to assignments, target criteria might need to be improved more. Provide detailed comments of what needs to be improved.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Improvement comments can be in criterion comments and/or in general comments.</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Refer to the criteria</p>
                <p class="section-text"> When you are aware that the student is struggling with their work or is unclear of the target criteria, refer to the criterion comments of the assignment.
                    Explain the given target criteria to the student and give examples.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">Refer to the assignment target criteria in the criterion comments (one criteria at a time)</p>

                <p class="section-text" style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional comments</p>
                <p class="section-text"> 
                    With the use of an Excel Spreadsheet feedback template, you may think that you cannot write a lot of comments inside cells, in fact that is not true.
                    You may put sentences inside cells and to make it visually comfortable, you can expand the cells.
                    Expanding cells will not affect the generated student feedback.
